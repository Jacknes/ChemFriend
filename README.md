# ChemFriend (Not yet ready for full release)

<div style="text-align:center"><img src ="http://i.imgur.com/mbO8DPm.jpg" /></div>

ChemFriend	looks	to	simplify	the process	of	applying	real	chemical	equations to	
aid	in	the	study	of	chemistry	in	High	School.
The	application	itself	includes	the	following	pages:
- Mole	Calculator
- Specific	Heat	Calculator
- Volume	Calculator
- Galvanic	Cell	Calculator
- Elemental	Quiz

This	 application	 has	 been	 built	 and	 shaped	 by	 my	 experience	 as	 a	 Chemistry	
student	and	falls	into	the	category	of	an	education	tool.	
Simplicity	was	a	major	focus,	looking	to	remove	any	overhead	and	just	be	purely	
about	helping	kids	understand	what	they	were	learning.	
Initially	 the	 application	 had	 a	 basic	 home	 screen	with	 a	 start	 button	 â€“ and	my	
planning	actually	involved	a	slideshow	of	screen	designs	with	instructions	with	
them.	However	on	implementation	this	decision	seemed	to	be	something	I	could	
not	integrate	in	a	slimline,	simplistic	way.	The	decision	to	scrap	the	home	screen	
brought	 the	 application	 more	 inline	 with	 the	 design	 specifications	 Apple	
recommends.
